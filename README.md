# Population of Genetics Project 1 summary

The first project examines the genetic structure and selection in three-spined stickleback populations, utilizing R to analyze environmental factors influencing genetic variation. Techniques include PCA and Fst analysis, revealing how migration and natural selection shape genetic diversity across different habitats.

# Population of Genetics Project 2 summary
The second project involves an in-depth analysis to identify outlier SNPs affecting three-spined stickleback populations. Employing methods like FstHet, OutFLANK, and PCAadapt, the study investigates the evolutionary and genomic processes driving SNP distribution, highlighting the role of natural selection and genetic drift in population differentiation.
